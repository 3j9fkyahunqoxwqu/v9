title: Detecting Weak but Hierarchically-Structured Patterns in Networks
abstract: The ability to detect weak distributed activation patterns in networks is
  critical to several applications, such as identifying the onset of anomalous activity
  or incipient congestion in the Internet, or faint traces of a biochemical spread
  by a sensor network.  This is a challenging problem since weak distributed patterns
  can be invisible in per node statistics as well as a global network-wide aggregate.
  Most prior work considers situations in which the activation/non-activation of each
  node is statistically independent, but this is unrealistic in many problems.  In
  this paper, we consider structured patterns arising from statistical dependencies
  in the activation process.  Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose
  a sparsifying transform that succinctly represents structured activation patterns
  that conform to a hierarchical dependency graph.  Second, we establish that the
  proposed transform facilitates detection of very weak activation patterns that cannot
  be detected with existing methods. Third, we show that the structure of the hierarchical
  dependency graph governing the activation process, and hence the network transform,
  can be learnt from very few (logarithmic in network size) independent snapshots
  of network activity.
