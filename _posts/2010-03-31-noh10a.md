title: Fluid Dynamics Models for Low Rank Discriminant Analysis
abstract: We consider the problem of reducing the dimensionality of labeled data for
  classification. Unfortunately, the optimal approach of finding the low-dimensional
  projection with minimal Bayes classification error is intractable, so most standard
  algorithms optimize a tractable heuristic function in the projected subspace. Here,
  we investigate a physics-based model where we consider the labeled data as interacting
  fluid distributions. We derive the forces arising in the fluids from information
  theoretic potential functions, and consider appropriate low rank constraints on
  the resulting acceleration and velocity flow fields.  We show how to apply the Gauss
  principle of least constraint in fluids to obtain tractable solutions for low rank
  projections. Our fluid dynamic approach is demonstrated to better approximate the
  Bayes optimal solution on Gaussian systems, including infinite dimensional Gaussian
  processes.
