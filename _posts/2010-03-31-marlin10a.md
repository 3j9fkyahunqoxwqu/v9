title: Inductive Principles for Restricted Boltzmann Machine Learning
abstract: Recent research has seen the proposal of several new inductive principles
  designed specifically to avoid the problems associated with maximum likelihood learning
  in models with intractable partition functions. In this paper, we study learning
  methods for binary restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) based on ratio matching
  and generalized score matching. We compare these new RBM learning methods to a range
  of existing learning methods including stochastic maximum likelihood, contrastive
  divergence, and pseudo-likelihood. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation
  across multiple tasks and data sets.
