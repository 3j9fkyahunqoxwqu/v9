title: Inference and Learning in Networks of Queues
abstract: Probabilistic models of the performance of computer systems are useful both
  for predicting system performance in new conditions, and for diagnosing past performance
  problems. The most popular performance models are networks of queues. However, no
  current methods exist for parameter estimation or inference in networks of queues
  with missing data. In this paper, we present a novel viewpoint that combines queueing
  networks and graphical models, allowing Markov chain Monte Carlo to be applied.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our sampler on real-world data from a benchmark
  Web application.
