title: Semi-Supervised Learning via Generalized Maximum Entropy
abstract: Various supervised inference methods can be analyzed as convex duals of
  the generalized maximum entropy (MaxEnt) framework. Generalized MaxEnt aims to find
  a distribution that maximizes an entropy function while respecting prior information
  represented as potential functions in miscellaneous forms of constraints and/or
  penalties. We extend this framework to semi-supervised learning by incorporating
  unlabeled data via modifications to these potential functions reflecting structural
  assumptions on the data geometry. The proposed approach leads to a family of discriminative
  semi-supervised algorithms, that are convex, scalable, inherently multi-class, easy
  to implement, and that can be kernelized naturally. Experimental evaluation of special
  cases shows the competitiveness of our methodology.
