title: Multitask Learning for Brain-Computer Interfaces
abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are limited in their applicability in everyday
  settings by the current necessity to record subject-specific calibration data prior
  to actual use of the BCI for communication. In this paper, we utilize the framework
  of multitask learning to construct a BCI that can be used without any subject-specific
  calibration process. We discuss how this out-of-the-box BCI can be further improved
  in a computationally efficient manner as subject-specific data becomes available.
  The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on two sets of experimental EEG
  data recorded during a standard two-class motor imagery paradigm from a total of
  19 healthy subjects. Specifically, we show that satisfactory classification results
  can be achieved with zero training data, and combining prior recordings with subject-specific
  calibration data substantially outperforms using subject-specific data only. Our
  results further show that transfer between recordings under slightly different experimental
  setups is feasible.
