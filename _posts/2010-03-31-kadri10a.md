title: 'Nonlinear functional regression: a functional RKHS approach'
abstract: This paper deals with functional regression, in which the input attributes
  as well as the response are functions. To deal with this problem, we develop a functional
  reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach; here, a kernel is an operator acting
  on a function and yielding a function. We demonstrate basic properties of these
  functional RKHS, as well as a representer theorem for this setting; we investigate
  the construction of kernels; we provide some experimental insight.
