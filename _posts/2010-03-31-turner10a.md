title: State-Space Inference and Learning with Gaussian Processes
abstract: State-space inference and learning with Gaussian processes (GPs) is an unsolved
  problem. We propose a new, general methodology for inference and learning in nonlinear
  state-space models that are described probabilistically by non-parametric GP models.
  We apply the expectation maximization algorithm to iterate between inference in
  the latent state-space and learning the parameters of the underlying GP dynamics
  model.
