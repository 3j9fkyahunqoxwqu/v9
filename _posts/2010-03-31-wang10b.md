title: Online Passive-Aggressive Algorithms on a Budget
abstract: In this paper a kernel-based online learning algorithm, which has both constant
  space and update time, is proposed. The approach is based on the popular online
  Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm. When used in conjunction with kernel function,
  the number of support vectors in PA grows without bounds when learning from noisy
  data streams. This implies unlimited memory and ever increasing model update and
  prediction time. To address this issue, the proposed budgeted PA algorithm maintains
  only a fixed number of support vectors. By introducing an additional constraint
  to the original PA optimization problem, a closed-form solution was derived for
  the support vector removal and model update. Using the hinge loss we developed several
  budgeted PA algorithms that can trade between accuracy and update cost. We also
  developed the ramp loss versions of both original and budgeted PA and showed that
  the resulting algorithms can be interpreted as the combination of active learning
  and hinge loss PA. All proposed algorithms were comprehensively tested on 7 benchmark
  data sets. The experiments showed that they are superior to the existing budgeted
  online algorithms. Even with modest budgets, the budgeted PA achieved very competitive
  accuracies to the non-budgeted PA and kernel perceptron algorithms.
