title: Reducing Label Complexity by Learning From Bags
abstract: We consider a supervised learning setting in which the main cost of learning
  is the number of training labels and one can obtain a single label for a bag of
  examples, indicating only if a positive example exists in the bag, as in Multi-Instance
  Learning. We thus propose to create a training sample of bags, and to use the obtained
  labels to learn to classify individual examples. We provide a theoretical analysis
  showing how to select the bag size as a function of the problem parameters, and
  prove that if the original labels are distributed unevenly, the number of required
  labels drops considerably when learning from bags. We demonstrate that finding a
  low-error separating hyperplane from bags is feasible in this setting using a simple
  iterative procedure similar to latent SVM. Experiments on synthetic and real data
  sets demonstrate the success of the approach.
