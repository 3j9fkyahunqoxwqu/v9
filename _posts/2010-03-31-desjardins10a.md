title: Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo for training of Restricted Boltzmann Machines
abstract: Alternating Gibbs sampling is the most common scheme used for sampling from
  Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), a crucial component in deep architectures such
  as Deep Belief Networks. However, we find that it often does a very poor job of
  rendering the diversity of modes captured by the trained model. We suspect that
  this hinders the advantage that could in principle be brought by training algorithms
  relying on Gibbs sampling for uncovering spurious modes, such as the Persistent
  Contrastive Divergence algorithm. To alleviate this problem, we explore the use
  of tempered Markov Chain Monte-Carlo for sampling in RBMs.  We find both through
  visualization of samples and measures of likelihood on a toy dataset that it helps
  both sampling and learning.
