title: Incremental Sparsification for Real-time Online Model Learning
abstract: Online model learning in real-time is required by many applications, for
  example, robot tracking control. It poses a difficult problem, as fast and incremental
  online regression with large data sets is the essential component and cannot be
  realized by straightforward usage of off-the-shelf machine learning methods such
  as Gaussian process regression or support vector regression. In this paper, we propose
  a framework for online, incremental sparsification with a fixed budget designed
  for large scale real-time model learning. The proposed approach combines a sparsification
  method based on an independency measure with a large scale database. In combination
  with an incremental learning approach such as sequential support vector regression,
  we obtain a regression method which is applicable in real-time online learning.
  It exhibits competitive learning accuracy when compared with standard regression
  techniques. Implementation on a real robot emphasizes the applicability of the proposed
  approach in real-time online model learning for real world systems.
