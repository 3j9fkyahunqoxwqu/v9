title: Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: We study contextual multi-armed bandit problems where the context comes
  from a metric space and the payoff satisfies a Lipschitz condition with respect
  to the metric.  Abstractly, a contextual multi-armed bandit problem models a situation
  where, in a sequence of independent trials, an online algorithm chooses, based on
  a given context (side information), an action from a set of possible actions so
  as to maximize the total payoff of the chosen actions.  The payoff depends on both
  the action chosen and the context. In contrast, context-free multi-armed bandit
  problems, a focus of much previous research, model situations where no side information
  is available and the payoff depends only on the action chosen.  Our problem is motivated
  by sponsored web search, where the task is to display ads to a user of an Internet
  search engine based on her search query so as to maximize the click-through rate
  (CTR) of the ads displayed.  We cast this problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit
  problem where queries and ads form metric spaces and the payoff function is Lipschitz
  with respect to both the metrics. For any ε> 0 we present an algorithm with regret
  O(T^\fraca+b+1a+b+2 + ε) where a,b are the covering dimensions of the query space
  and the ad space respectively. We prove a lower bound Ω(T^\frac\tildea+\tildeb+1\tildea+\tildeb+2
  ε) for the regret of any algorithm where \tildea, \tildeb are packing dimensions
  of the query spaces and the ad space respectively. For finite spaces or convex bounded
  subsets of Euclidean spaces, this gives an almost matching upper and lower bound.
