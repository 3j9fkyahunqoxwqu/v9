title: Dirichlet Process Mixtures of Generalized Linear Models
abstract: We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLMs),
  a new method of nonparametric regression that accommodates continuous and categorical
  inputs, models a response variable locally by a generalized linear model.  We give
  conditions for the existence and asymptotic unbiasedness of the DP-GLM regression
  mean function estimate;  we then give a practical example for when those conditions
  hold. We evaluate DP-GLM on several data sets, comparing it to modern methods of
  nonparametric regression including regression trees and Gaussian processes.
