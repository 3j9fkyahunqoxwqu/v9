title: Efficient Multioutput Gaussian Processes through Variational Inducing Kernels
abstract: 'Interest in multioutput kernel methods is increasing, whether under the
  guise of multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From
  the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function
  over correlated output functions. One way to construct such kernels is based on
  convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference.
  Alvarez and Lawrence recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled
  efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce
  the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions
  involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to
  approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias
  (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction
  of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series.'
