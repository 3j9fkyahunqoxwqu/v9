title: Guarantees for Approximate Incremental SVMs
abstract: Assume a teacher provides examples one by one. An approximate incremental
  SVM computes a sequence of classifiers that are close to the true SVM solutions
  computed on the successive incremental training sets. We show that simple algorithms
  can satisfy an averaged accuracy criterion with a computational cost that scales
  as well as the best SVM algorithms with the number of examples. Finally, we exhibit
  some experiments highlighting the benefits of joining fast incremental optimization
  and curriculum and active learning (Schon and Cohn, 2000; Bordes et al., 2005; Bengio
  et al., 2009).
