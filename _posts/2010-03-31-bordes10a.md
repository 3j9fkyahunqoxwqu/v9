title: Towards Understanding Situated Natural Language
abstract: 'We present a general framework and learning algorithm for the task of concept
  labeling: each word in a given sentence has to be tagged with the unique physical
  entity (e.g. person, object or location) or abstract concept it refers to. Our method
  allows both world knowledge and linguistic information to be used during learning
  and prediction. We show experimentally that we can learn to use world knowledge
  to resolve ambiguities in language, such as word senses or reference resolution,
  without the use of handcrafted rules or features.'
