title: 'Noise-contrastive estimation: A new estimation principle for unnormalized
  statistical models'
abstract: 'We present a new estimation principle for parameterized statistical models.
  The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the
  observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density
  function in the regression nonlinearity.  We show that this leads to a consistent
  (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance.  In
  particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models
  where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant
  can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare
  the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized
  models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood
  where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations
  show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational
  and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural
  images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer
  model and a Markov random field.'
