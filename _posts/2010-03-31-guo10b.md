title: Real-time Multiattribute Bayesian Preference Elicitation with Pairwise Comparison
  Queries
abstract: 'Preference elicitation (PE) is an important component of interactive decision
  support systems that aim to make optimal recommendations to users by actively querying
  their preferences.  In this paper, we outline five principles important for PE in
  real-world problems: (1) real-time, (2) multiattribute, (3) low cognitive load,
  (4) robust to noise, and (5) scalable.  In light of these requirements, we introduce
  an approximate PE framework based on TrueSkill for performing efficient closed-form
  Bayesian updates and query selection for a multiattribute utility belief state ---
  a novel PE approach that naturally facilitates the efficient evaluation of value
  of information (VOI) heuristics for use in query selection strategies.  Our best
  VOI query strategy satisfies all five principles (in contrast to related work) and
  performs on par with the most accurate (and often computationally intensive) algorithms
  on experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets.'
