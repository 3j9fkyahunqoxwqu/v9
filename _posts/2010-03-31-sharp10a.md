title: Dense Message Passing for Sparse Principal Component Analysis
abstract: We describe a novel inference algorithm for sparse Bayesian PCA with a  zero-norm
  prior on the model parameters. Bayesian inference is very  challenging in probabilistic
  models of this type. MCMC procedures are  too slow to be practical in a very high-dimensional
  setting and standard  mean-field variational Bayes algorithms are ineffective.  We
  adopt a  dense message passing algorithm similar to algorithms developed in the  statistical  physics
  community and previously applied to inference  problems in coding and sparse classification.
  The algorithm achieves  near-optimal performance on synthetic data for which a statistical  mechanics
  theory of optimal learning can be derived. We also study two  gene expression datasets
  used in previous studies of sparse PCA. We find our  method  performs better than
  one published algorithm and comparably to a second.
