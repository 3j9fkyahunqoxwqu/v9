title: Bayesian Generalized Kernel Models
abstract: We propose a fully Bayesian approach for generalized kernel models (GKMs),
  which are extensions of generalized linear models in the feature space induced by
  a reproducing kernel. We place a mixture of a point-mass distribution and Silvermanâ€™s
  g-prior on the regression vector of GKMs. This mixture prior allows a fraction of
  the regression vector to be zero.  Thus, it serves for sparse modeling and Bayesian
  computation.  For inference, we exploit data augmentation methodology to develop
  a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which the reversible jump method
  is used for model selection and a Bayesian model averaging method is used for posterior
  prediction.
