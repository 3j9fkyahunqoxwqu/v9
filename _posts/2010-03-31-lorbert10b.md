title: Exploiting Covariate Similarity in Sparse Regression via the Pairwise Elastic
  Net
abstract: A new approach to regression regularization called the Pairwise Elastic
  Net is proposed. Like the Elastic Net, it simultaneously performs automatic variable
  selection and continuous shrinkage. In addition, the Pairwise Elastic Net encourages
  the grouping of strongly correlated predictors based on a pairwise similarity measure.
  We give examples of how the Pairwise Elastic Net can be used to achieve the objectives
  of Ridge regression, the Lasso, the Elastic Net, and Group Lasso. Finally, we present
  a coordinate descent algorithm to solve the Pairwise Elastic Net.
