title: Relating Function Class Complexity and Cluster Structure in the Function Domain
  with Applications to Transduction
abstract: We relate function class complexity to structure in the function domain.
  This facilitates risk analysis relative to cluster structure in the input space
  which is particularly effective in semi-supervised learning. In particular we quantify
  the complexity of function classes defined over a graph in terms of the graph structure.
