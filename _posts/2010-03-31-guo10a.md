title: Sufficient covariates and linear propensity analysis
abstract: Working within the decision-theoretic framework for causal inference, we
  study the properties of ``sufficient covariates", which support causal inference
  from observational data, and possibilities for their reduction. In particular we
  illustrate the role of a propensity variable by means of a simple model, and explain
  why such a reduction typically does not increase (and may reduce) estimation efficiency.
