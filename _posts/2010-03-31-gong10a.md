title: Locally Linear Denoising on Image Manifolds
abstract: We study the problem of image denoising where images are assumed to be samples
  from low dimensional  (sub)manifolds. We propose the algorithm of locally linear
  denoising. The algorithm approximates manifolds with locally linear patches by constructing
  nearest neighbor graphs. Each image is then locally denoised within its neighborhoods.
  A global optimal denoising result is then identified by aligning those local estimates.
  The algorithm has a closed-form solution that is efficient to compute. We evaluated
  and compared the algorithm to alternative methods on two image data sets. We demonstrated
  the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which yields visually appealing denoising
  results, incurs smaller reconstruction errors and results in lower error rates when
  the denoised data are used in supervised learning tasks.
