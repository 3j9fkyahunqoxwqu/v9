title: Learning Bayesian Network Structure using LP Relaxations
abstract: We propose to solve the combinatorial problem of finding the highest scoring
  Bayesian network structure from data. This structure learning problem can be viewed
  as an inference problem where the variables specify the choice of parents for each
  node in the graph. The key combinatorial difficulty arises from the global constraint
  that the graph structure has to be acyclic. We cast the structure learning problem
  as a linear program over the polytope defined by valid acyclic structures. In relaxing
  this problem, we maintain an outer bound approximation to the polytope and iteratively
  tighten it by searching over a new class of valid constraints. If an integral solution
  is found, it is guaranteed to be the optimal Bayesian network. When the relaxation
  is not tight, the fast dual algorithms we develop remain useful in combination with
  a branch and bound method. Empirical results suggest that the method is competitive
  or faster than alternative exact methods based on dynamic programming.
