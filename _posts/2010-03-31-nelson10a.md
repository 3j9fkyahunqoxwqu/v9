title: Near-Optimal Evasion of Convex-Inducing Classifiers
abstract: Classifiers are often used to detect miscreant activities. We study how
  an adversary can efficiently query a classifier to elicit information that allows
  the adversary to evade detection at near-minimal cost. We generalize results of
  Lowd and Meek (2005) to convex-inducing classifiers. We present algorithms that
  construct undetected instances of near-minimal cost using only polynomially many
  queries in the dimension of the space and without reverse engineering the decision
  boundary.
