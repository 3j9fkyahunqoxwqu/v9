title: Supervised Dimension Reduction Using Bayesian Mixture Modeling
abstract: 'We develop a Bayesian framework for supervised dimension reduction using
  a flexible nonparametric Bayesian mixture modeling approach. Our method retrieves
  the dimension reduction or d.r. subspace by utilizing a dependent Dirichlet process
  that allows for natural clustering for the data in terms of both the response and
  predictor variables. Formal probabilistic models with likelihoods and priors are
  given and efficient posterior sampling of the d.r. subspace can be obtained by a
  Gibbs sampler. As the posterior draws are linear subspaces which are points on a
  Grassmann manifold, we output the posterior mean d.r. subspace with respect to geodesics
  on the Grassmannian. The utility of our approach is illustrated on a set of simulated
  and real examples.  Some Key Words: supervised dimension reduction, inverse regression,
  Dirichlet process, factor models, Grassman manifold.'
