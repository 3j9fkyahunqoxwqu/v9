title: Improving posterior marginal approximations in latent Gaussian models
abstract: We consider the problem of correcting the posterior marginal approximations
  computed by expectation propagation and Laplace approximation in latent Gaussian
  models and propose correction methods that are similar in spirit to the Laplace
  approximation of Tierney and Kadane (1986). We show that in the case of sparse Gaussian
  models, the computational complexity of expectation propagation can be made comparable
  to that of the Laplace approximation by using a parallel updating scheme. In some
  cases, expectation propagation gives excellent estimates, where the Laplace approximation
  fails. Inspired by bounds on the marginal corrections, we arrive at factorized approximations,
  which can be applied on top of both expectation propagation and Laplace. These give
  nearly indistinguishable results from the non-factorized approximations in a fraction
  of the time.
