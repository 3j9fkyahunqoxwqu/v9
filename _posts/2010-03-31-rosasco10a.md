title: A Regularization Approach to Nonlinear Variable Selection
abstract: In this paper we consider a regularization approach to variable selection
  when the regression function depends nonlinearly on a few input variables. The proposed
  method is based on a regularized least square estimator penalizing large values
  of the partial derivatives. An efficient iterative procedure is proposed to solve
  the underlying variational problem, and its convergence is proved. The empirical
  properties of the obtained estimator are tested both for prediction and variable
  selection. The algorithm compares favorably to more standard ridge regression and
  L1 regularization schemes.
