title: Approximation of hidden Markov models by mixtures of experts with application
  to particle filtering
abstract: Selecting conveniently the proposal kernel and the adjustment multiplier
  weights of the auxiliary particle filter may increase significantly the accuracy
  and computational efficiency of the method. However, in practice the optimal proposal
  kernel and multiplier weights are seldom known. In this paper we present a simulation-based
  method for constructing offline an approximation of these quantities that makes
  the filter close to fully adapted at a reasonable computational cost. The approximation
  is constructed as a mixture of experts optimised through an efficient stochastic
  approximation algorithm. The method is illustrated on two simulated examples.
