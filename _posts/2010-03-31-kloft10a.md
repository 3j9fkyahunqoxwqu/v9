title: Online Anomaly Detection under Adversarial Impact
abstract: 'Security analysis of learning algorithms is gaining increasing importance,
  especially since they have become target of deliberate obstruction in certain applications.
  Some security-hardened algorithms have been previously proposed for supervised learning;
  however, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in
  such scenarios. In this contribution, we analyze the performance of a particular
  method—online centroid anomaly detection—in the presence of adversarial noise. Our
  analysis addresses three key security-related issues: derivation of an optimal attack,
  analysis of its efficiency and constraints. Experimental evaluation carried out
  on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds.'
