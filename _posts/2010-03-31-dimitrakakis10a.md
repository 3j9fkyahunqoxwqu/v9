title: Bayesian variable order Markov models
abstract: We present a simple, effective generalisation of variable order   Markov
  models to full online Bayesian estimation. The mechanism used   is close to that
  employed in context tree weighting. The main   contribution is the addition of a
  prior, conditioned on context, on   the Markov order. The resulting construction
  uses a simple recursion   and can be updated efficiently. This allows the model
  to make   predictions using more complex contexts, as more data is acquired,   if
  necessary.  In addition, our model can be alternatively seen as a   mixture of tree
  experts.  Experimental results show that the   predictive model exhibits consistently
  good performance in a variety   of domains.
