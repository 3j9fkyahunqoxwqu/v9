title: Deterministic Bayesian inference for the p* model
abstract: The p* model is widely used in social network analysis. The likelihood of
  a network under this model is impossible to calculate for all but trivially small
  networks. Various approximation have been presented in  the literature, and the
  pseudolikelihood approximation is the most popular. The aim of this paper is to
  introduce two likelihood approximations which have the pseudolikelihood estimator
  as a special case. We show, for the examples that we have considered, that both
  approximations result in improved estimation of model parameters with respect to
  the standard methodological approaches. We provide a deterministic  approach and
  also illustrate how Bayesian model choice can be carried out in this setting.
