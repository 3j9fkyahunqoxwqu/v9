title: Graphical Gaussian modelling of multivariate time series with latent variables
abstract: In time series analysis, inference about cause-effect relationships among
  multiple times series is commonly based on the concept of Granger causality, which
  exploits temporal structure to achieve causal ordering of dependent variables. One
  major problem in the application of Granger causality for the identification of
  causal relationships is the possible presence of latent variables that affect the
  measured components and thus lead to so-called spurious causalities. In this paper,
  we describe a new graphical approach for modelling the dependence structure of multivariate
  stationary time series that are affected by latent variables. To this end, we introduce
  dynamic maximal ancestral graphs (dMAGs), in which each time series is represented
  by a single vertex. For Gaussian processes, this approach leads to vector autoregressive
  models with errors that are not independent but correlated according to the dashed
  edges in the graph. We discuss identifiability of the parameters and show that these
  models can be viewed as graphical ARMA models that satisfy the Granger causality
  restrictions encoded by the associated dynamic maximal ancestral graph.
