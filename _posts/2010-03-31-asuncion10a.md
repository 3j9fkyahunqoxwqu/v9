title: 'Learning with Blocks: Composite Likelihood and Contrastive Divergence'
abstract: Composite likelihood methods provide a wide spectrum of computationally
  efficient techniques for statistical tasks such as parameter estimation and model
  selection. In this paper, we present a formal connection between the optimization
  of composite likelihoods and the well-known contrastive divergence algorithm. In
  particular, we show that composite likelihoods can be stochastically optimized by
  performing a variant of contrastive divergence with random-scan blocked Gibbs sampling.
  By using higher-order composite likelihoods, our proposed learning framework makes
  it possible to trade off computation time for increased accuracy. Furthermore, one
  can choose composite likelihood blocks that match the modelâ€™s dependence structure,
  making the optimization of higher-order composite likelihoods computationally efficient.  We
  empirically analyze the performance of blocked contrastive divergence on various
  models, including visible Boltzmann machines, conditional random fields, and exponential
  random graph models, and we demonstrate that using higher-order blocks improves
  both the accuracy of parameter estimates and the rate of convergence.
