title: Discriminative Topic Segmentation of Text and Speech
abstract: We explore automated discovery of topically-coherent segments in speech
  or text sequences. We give two new discriminative topic segmentation algorithms
  which employ a new measure of text similarity based on word co-occurrence. Both
  algorithms function by finding extrema in the similarity signal over the text, with
  the latter algorithm using a compact support-vector based description of a window
  of text or speech observations in word similarity space to overcome noise introduced
  by speech recognition errors and off-topic content. In experiments over speech and
  text news streams, we show that these algorithms outperform previous methods. We
  observe that topic segmentation of speech recognizer output is a more difficult
  problem than that of text streams; however, we demonstrate that by using a lattice
  of competing hypotheses rather than just the one-best hypothesis as input to the
  segmentation algorithm, the performance of the algorithm can be improved.
