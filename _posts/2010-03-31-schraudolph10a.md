title: Polynomial-Time Exact Inference in NP-Hard Binary MRFs via Reweighted Perfect
  Matching
abstract: We develop a new form of reweighting (Wainwright et al., 2005) to leverage
  the relationship between Ising spin glasses and perfect matchings into a novel technique
  for the exact computation of MAP states in hitherto intractable binary Markov random
  fields. Our method solves an n by n lattice with external field and random couplings
  much faster, and for larger n, than the best competing algorithms. It empirically
  scales as O(nÂ³) even though this problem is NP-hard and non-approximable in polynomial
  time. We discuss limitations of our current implementation and propose ways to overcome
  them.
