title: 'REGO: Rank-based Estimation of Renyi Information using Euclidean Graph Optimization'
abstract: We propose a new method for a non-parametric estimation of Renyi and Shannon
  information for a multivariate distribution using a corresponding copula, a multivariate
  distribution over normalized ranks of the data. As the information of the distribution
  is the same as the negative entropy of its copula, our method estimates this information
  by solving a Euclidean graph optimization problem on the empirical estimate of the
  distribution’s copula. Owing to the properties of the copula, we show that the resulting
  estimator of Renyi information is strongly consistent and robust. Further, we demonstrate
  its applicability in the image registration in addition to simulated experiments.
