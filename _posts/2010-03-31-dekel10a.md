title: Multiclass-Multilabel Classification with More Classes than Examples
abstract: 'We discuss multiclass-multilabel classification problems in which   the
  set of possible labels is extremely large. Most existing   multiclass-multilabel
  learning algorithms expect to observe a   reasonably large sample from each class,
  and fail if they receive   only a handful of examples with a given label. We propose
  and   analyze the following two-stage approach: first use an arbitrary   (perhaps
  heuristic) classification algorithm to construct an initial   classifier, then apply
  a simple but principled method to augment   this classifier by removing harmful
  labels from its output.  A   careful theoretical analysis allows us to justify our
  approach under   some reasonable conditions (such as label sparsity and power-law   distribution
  of label frequencies), even when the training set does   not provide a statistically
  accurate representation of most   classes. Surprisingly, our theoretical analysis
  continues to hold   even when the number of classes exceeds the sample size. We   demonstrate
  the merits of our approach on the ambitious task of   categorizing the entire web
  using the 1.5 million categories   defined on Wikipedia.'
