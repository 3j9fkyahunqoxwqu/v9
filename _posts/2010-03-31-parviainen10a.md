title: Bayesian structure discovery in Bayesian networks with less space
abstract: Current exact algorithms for score-based structure discovery in Bayesian
  networks on n nodes run in time and space within a polynomial factor of 2^n. For
  practical use, the space requirement is the bottleneck, which motivates trading
  space against time. Here, previous results on finding an optimal network structure
  in less space are extended in two directions. First, we consider the problem of
  computing the posterior probability of a given arc set. Second, we operate with
  the general partial order framework and its specialization to bucket orders,  introduced
  recently for related permutation problems. The main technical contribution is the
  development of a fast algorithm for a novel zeta transform variant, which may be
  of independent interest.
