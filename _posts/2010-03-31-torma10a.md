title: A Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Approach to Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
abstract: A Markov-Chain Monte Carlo based algorithm is provided to solve the simultaneous
  localization and mapping (SLAM) problem with general dynamical and observation models
  under open-loop control and provided that the map-representation is finite dimensional.
  To our knowledge this is the first provably consistent yet (close-to) practical
  solution to this problem. The superiority of our algorithm over alternative SLAM
  algorithms is demonstrated in a difficult loop closing situation.
