title: Matrix-Variate Dirichlet Process Mixture Models
abstract: We are concerned with a multivariate response regression problem where the
  interest is in considering correlations both across response variates and across
  response samples. In this paper we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric model for
  such a setting based on Dirichlet process priors. Building on an additive kernel
  model, we allow each sample to have its own regression matrix. Although this overcomplete
  representation could in principle suffer from severe overfitting problems, we are
  able to provide effective control over the model via a matrix-variate Dirichlet
  process prior on the regression matrices. Our model is able to share statistical
  strength among regression matrices due to the clustering property of the Dirichlet
  process. We make use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference and prediction.
  Compared with other Bayesian kernel models, our model has advantages in both computational
  and statistical efficiency.
