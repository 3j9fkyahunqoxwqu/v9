title: Feature Selection using Multiple Streams
abstract: Feature selection for supervised learning can be greatly improved by making
  use of the fact that features often come in classes. For example, in gene  expression
  data, the genes which serve as features may be  divided into classes based on their
  membership in gene families or pathways. When labeling words with senses for word
  sense disambiguation, features fall into classes including adjacent words, their
  parts of speech, and the topic and venue of the document the word is in. We present
  a streamwise feature selection method that allows  dynamic generation and selection
  of features, while taking advantage of the different feature classes, and the fact
  that they are of different sizes and have different (but unknown) fractions of good
  features. Experimental results show that our approach provides significant improvement
  in performance and is computationally less expensive than comparable “batch” methods
  that do not take advantage of the feature classes and expect all features to be
  known in advance.
