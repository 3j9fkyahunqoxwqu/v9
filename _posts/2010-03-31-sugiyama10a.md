title: Conditional Density Estimation via Least-Squares Density Ratio Estimation
abstract: Estimating the conditional mean of an input-output relation is the goal
  of regression. However, regression analysis is not sufficiently informative if the
  conditional distribution has multi-modality, is highly asymmetric, or contains heteroscedastic
  noise. In such scenarios, estimating the conditional distribution itself would be
  more useful. In this paper, we propose a novel method of conditional density estimation
  that is suitable for multi-dimensional continuous variables. The basic idea of the
  proposed method is to express the conditional density in terms of the density ratio
  and the ratio is directly estimated without going through density estimation. Experiments
  using benchmark and robot transition datasets illustrate the usefulness of the proposed
  approach.
