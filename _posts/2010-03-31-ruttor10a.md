title: Approximate parameter inference in a stochastic reaction-diffusion model
abstract: We present an approximate inference approach to parameter estimation in
  a spatio-temporal stochastic process of the reaction-diffusion type. The continuous
  space limit of an inference method for Markov jump processes leads to an approximation
  which is related to a spatial Gaussian process. An efficient solution in feature
  space using a Fourier basis is applied to inference on simulational data.
