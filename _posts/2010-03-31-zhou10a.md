title: Exclusive Lasso for Multi-task Feature Selection
abstract: We propose a novel group regularization which we call exclusive lasso. Unlike
  the group lasso regularizer that assumes co-varying variables in groups, the proposed
  exclusive lasso regularizer models the scenario when variables in the same group
  compete with each other. Analysis is presented to illustrate the properties of the
  proposed regularizer. We present a framework of kernel-based multi-task feature
  selection algorithm based on the proposed exclusive lasso regularizer. An efficient
  algorithm is derived to solve the related optimization problem. Experiments with
  document categorization show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms
  for multi-task feature selection.
