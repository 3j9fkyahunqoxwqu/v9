title: The Group Dantzig Selector
abstract: We introduce a new method -- the  group Dantzig selector -- for high dimensional
  sparse regression with  group structure, which has a convincing theory about why
  utilizing the group structure can be beneficial. Under a  group restricted isometry
  condition,  we obtain a significantly improved nonasymptotic L2-norm bound over
  the basis pursuit or the Dantzig selector which ignores the group structure.   To
  gain more insight, we also introduce a surprisingly simple and intuitive  ``sparsity
  oracle condition'' to obtain a block L1-norm bound,  which is easily accessible
  to a broad audience in machine learning community. Encouraging numerical results
  are also provided to support our theory.
