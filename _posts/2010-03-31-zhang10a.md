title: Risk Bounds for Levy Processes in the PAC-Learning Framework
abstract: Levy processes play an important role in the stochastic process theory.
  However, since samples are non-i.i.d., statistical learning results based on the
  i.i.d. scenarios cannot be utilized to study the risk bounds for Levy processes.
  In this paper, we present risk bounds for non-i.i.d. samples drawn from Levy processes
  in the PAC-learning framework. In particular, by using a concentration inequality
  for infinitely divisible distributions, we first prove that the function of risk
  error is Lipschitz continuous with a high probability, and then by using a specific
  concentration inequality for Levy processes, we obtain the risk bounds for non-i.i.d.
  samples drawn from Levy processes without Gaussian components. Based on the resulted
  risk bounds, we analyze the factors that affect the convergence of the risk bounds
  and then prove the convergence.
