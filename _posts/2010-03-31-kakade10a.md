title: 'Learning Exponential Families in High-Dimensions: Strong Convexity and Sparsity'
abstract: The versatility of exponential families, along with their attendant convexity
  properties, make them a popular and effective statistical model. A central issue
  is learning these models in high-dimensions when the optimal parameter  vector is
  sparse. This work characterizes a certain strong convexity property of general exponential
  families, which allows their generalization ability to be quantified. In particular,
  we show how this property can be used to analyze generic exponential families under
  L1 regularization.
