title: Convexity of Proper Composite Binary Losses
abstract: A composite loss assigns a penalty to a real-valued prediction by associating
  the prediction with a probability via a link function then applying a class probability
  estimation (CPE) loss. If the risk for a composite loss is always minimised by predicting
  the value associated with the true class probability the composite loss is proper.
  We provide a novel, explicit and complete characterisation of the convexity of any
  proper composite loss in terms of its link and its “weight function” associated
  with its proper CPE loss.
