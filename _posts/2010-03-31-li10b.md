title: Simple Exponential Family PCA
abstract: Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA), a probabilistic reformulation
  of PCA with Bayesian model selection, is a systematic approach to determining the
  number of essential principal components (PCs) for data representation.  However,
  it assumes that data are Gaussian distributed and thus it cannot handle all types
  of practical observations, e.g. integers and binary values.  In this paper, we propose
  simple exponential family PCA (SePCA), a generalised family of probabilistic principal
  component analysers. SePCA employs exponential family distributions to handle general
  types of observations. By using Bayesian inference, SePCA also automatically discovers
  the number of essential PCs. We discuss techniques for fitting the model, develop
  the corresponding mixture model, and show the effectiveness of the model based on
  experiments.
