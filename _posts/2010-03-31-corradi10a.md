title: Mass Fatality Incident Identification based on nuclear DNA evidence
abstract: This paper focuses on the use of nuclear DNA Short Tandem Repeat traits
  for the identification of the victims of a Mass Fatality Incident. The goal of the
  analysis is  the assessment of the identification probabilities concerning the  recovered
  victims.  Identification hypotheses are evaluated conditionally to the DNA evidence
  observed both on the recovered victims and on the relatives of the missing persons
  disappeared in the tragical event. After specifying  a set of conditional independence
  assertions suitable for the problem, an inference strategy is provided, treating
  some points to achieve computational efficiency.  Finally, the proposal is tested
  through the simulation of a Mass Fatality Incident and the results are  examined
  in details.
