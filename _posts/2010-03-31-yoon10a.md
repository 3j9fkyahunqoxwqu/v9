title: A highly efficient blocked Gibbs sampler reconstruction of multidimensional
  NMR spectra
abstract: Projection Reconstruction Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (PR-NMR) is a new technique
  to generate multi-dimensional NMR spectra, which have discrete features that are
  relatively sparsely distributed in space. A small number of projections from lower
  dimensional NMR spectra are used to reconstruct the multi-dimensional NMR spectra.
  We propose an efficient algorithm which employs a blocked Gibbs sampler to accurately
  reconstruct NMR spectra. This statistical method generates samples in Bayesian scheme.
  Our proposed algorithm is tested on a set of six projections derived from the three-dimensional
  700 MHz HNCO spectrum of HasA, a 187-residue heme binding protein.
