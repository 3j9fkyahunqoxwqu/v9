title: Parametric Herding
abstract: A parametric version of herding is formulated. The nonlinear mapping between
  consecutive time slices is learned by a form of self-supervised training. The resulting
  dynamical system generates pseudo-samples that resemble the original data. We show
  how this parametric herding can be successfully used to compress a dataset consisting
  of binary digits. It is also verified that high compression rates translate into
  good prediction performance on unseen test data.
