title: Maximum-likelihood learning of cumulative distribution functions on graphs
abstract: For many applications, a probability model can be easily expressed as a
  cumulative distribution functions (CDF) as compared to the use of probability density
  or mass functions (PDF/PMFs).  Cumulative distribution networks (CDNs) have recently
  been proposed as a class of graphical models for CDFs. One advantage of CDF models
  is the simplicity of representing multivariate heavy-tailed distributions. Examples
  of fields that can benefit from the use of graphical models for CDFs include climatology
  and epidemiology, where data may follow extreme value statistics and exhibit spatial
  correlations so that dependencies between model variables must be accounted for.
  The problem of learning from data in such settings may nevertheless consist of optimizing
  the log-likelihood function with respect to model parameters where we are required
  to optimize a log-PDF/PMF and not a log-CDF.   We present a message-passing algorithm
  called the gradient-derivative-product (GDP) algorithm that allows us to learn the
  model in terms of the log-likelihood function whereby messages correspond to local
  gradients of the likelihood with respect to model parameters.  We will demonstrate
  the GDP algorithm on real-world rainfall and H1N1 mortality data and we will show
  that CDNs provide a natural choice of parameterizations for the heavy-tailed multivariate
  distributions that arise in these problems.
