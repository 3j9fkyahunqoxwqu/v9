title: Elliptical slice sampling
abstract: 'Many probabilistic models introduce strong dependencies between variables
  using a latent multivariate Gaussian distribution or a Gaussian process. We present
  a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for performing inference in models with
  multivariate Gaussian priors. Its key properties are: 1) it has simple, generic
  code applicable to many models, 2) it has no free parameters, 3) it works well for
  a variety of Gaussian process based models. These properties make our method ideal
  for use while model building, removing the need to spend time deriving and tuning
  updates for more complex algorithms.'
