title: 'HOP-MAP: Efficient Message Passing with High Order Potentials'
abstract: There is a growing interest in building probabilistic models with high order
  potentials (HOPs), or interactions, among discrete variables.  Message passing inference
  in such models generally takes time exponential in the size of the interaction,
  but in some cases maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference can be carried out efficiently.   We
  build upon such results,  introducing two new classes, including composite HOPs
  that allow us to flexibly combine tractable HOPs using simple logical switching
  rules. We present efficient message update algorithms for the new HOPs, and we improve
  upon the efficiency of message updates for a general class of existing HOPs. Importantly,
  we present both new and existing HOPs in a common representation;  performing inference
  with any combination of these HOPs requires no change of representations or new
  derivations.
