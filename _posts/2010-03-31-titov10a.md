title: Unsupervised Aggregation for Classification Problems with Large Numbers of
  Categories
abstract: Classification problems with a very large or unbounded set of output categories
  are common in many areas such as natural language and image processing. In order
  to improve accuracy on these tasks, it is natural for a  decision-maker to  combine
  predictions from various  sources.  However, supervised data needed to fit an aggregation
  model  is often difficult to obtain, especially if needed for multiple domains.
  Therefore, we propose a generative model for unsupervised aggregation which exploits
  the agreement signal to estimate the expertise of individual judges.  Due to the
  large output space size, this aggregation model cannot encode expertise of constituent
  judges with respect to every category for all problems. Consequently, we extend
  it by incorporating the notion of category types  to account for variability  of
  the judge expertise depending on the type.  The viability of our approach is demonstrated
  both on synthetic experiments and on a practical task of syntactic parser aggregation.
