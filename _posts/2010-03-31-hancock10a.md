title: Boosted Optimization for Network Classification
abstract: In this paper we propose a new classification algorithm designed for application
  on complex networks motivated by algorithmic similarities between boosting learning
  and message passing.  We consider a network classifier as a logistic regression
  where the variables define the nodes and the interaction effects define the edges.  From
  this definition we represent the problem as a factor graph of local exponential
  loss functions.  Using the factor graph representation it is possible to interpret
  the network classifier as an ensemble of individual node classifiers.  We then combine
  ideas from boosted learning with network optimization algorithms to define two novel
  algorithms, Boosted Expectation Propagation (BEP) and Boosted Message Passing (BMP).  These
  algorithms optimize the global network classifier performance by locally weighting
  each node classifier by the error of the surrounding network structure.  We compare
  the performance of BEP and BMP to logistic regression as well state of the art penalized
  logistic regression models on simulated grid structured networks.  The results show
  that using local boosting to optimize the performance of a network classifier increases
  classification performance and is especially powerful in cases when the whole network
  structure must be considered for accurate classification.
