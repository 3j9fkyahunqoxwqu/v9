title: Active Sequential Learning with Tactile Feedback
abstract: 'We consider the problem of tactile discrimination, with the goal of estimating
  an underlying state parameter in a sequential setting. If the data is continuous
  and high-dimensional, collecting enough representative data samples becomes difficult.
  We present a framework that uses active learning to help with the sequential gathering
  of data samples, using information-theoretic criteria to find optimal actions at
  each time step. We consider two approaches to recursively update the state parameter
  belief: an analytical Gaussian approximation and a Monte Carlo sampling method.
  We show how both active frameworks improve convergence, demonstrating results on
  a real robotic hand-arm system that estimates the viscosity of liquids from tactile
  feedback data.'
