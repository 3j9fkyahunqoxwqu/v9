title: On Combining Graph-based Variance Reduction schemes
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider two variance reduction schemes that exploit
  the structure of the primal graph of the graphical model: Rao-Blackwellised w-cutset
  sampling and AND/OR sampling. We show that the two schemes are orthogonal and can
  be combined to further reduce the variance. Our combination yields a new family
  of estimators which trade time and space with variance. We demonstrate experimentally
  that the new estimators are superior, often yielding an order of magnitude improvement
  over previous schemes on several benchmarks.'
