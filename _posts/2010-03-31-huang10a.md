title: Collaborative Filtering via Rating Concentration
abstract: While most popular collaborative filtering methods use low-rank matrix factorization
  and parametric density assumptions, this article proposes an approach based on distribution-free
  concentration inequalities. Using agnostic hierarchical sampling assumptions, functions
  of observed ratings are provably close to their expectations over query ratings,
  on average. A joint probability distribution over queries of interest is estimated
  using maximum entropy regularization. The distribution resides in a convex hull
  of allowable candidate distributions which satisfy concentration inequalities that
  stem from the sampling assumptions. The method accurately estimates rating distributions
  on synthetic and real data and is competitive with low rank and parametric methods
  which make more aggressive assumptions about the problem.
