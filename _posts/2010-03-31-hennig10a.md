title: Coherent Inference on Optimal Play in Game Trees
abstract: Round-based games are an instance of discrete planning problems. Some of
  the best contemporary game tree search algorithms use random roll-outs as data.
  Relying on a good policy, they learn on-policy values by propagating information
  upwards in the tree, but not between sibling nodes. Here, we present a generative
  model and a corresponding approximate message passing scheme for inference on the
  optimal, off-policy value of nodes in smooth AND/OR trees, given random roll-outs.
  The crucial insight is that the distribution of values in game trees is not completely
  arbitrary. We define a generative model of the on-policy values using a latent score
  for each state, representing the value under the random roll-out policy. Inference
  on the values under the optimal policy separates into an inductive, pre-data step
  and a deductive, post-data part. Both can be solved approximately with Expectation
  Propagation, allowing off-policy value inference for any node in the (exponentially
  big) tree in linear time.
