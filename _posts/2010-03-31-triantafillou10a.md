title: Learning Causal Structure from Overlapping Variable Sets
abstract: We present an algorithm name cSAT+ for learning the causal structure in
  a domain from datasets measuring different variables sets. The algorithm outputs
  a graph with edges corresponding to all possible pairwise causal relations between
  two variables, named Pairwise Causal Graph (PCG). Examples of interesting inferences
  include the induction of the absence or presence of some causal relation between
  two variables never measured together. cSAT+ converts the problem to a series of
  SAT problems, obtaining leverage from the efficiency of state-of-the-art solvers.
  In our empirical evaluation, it is shown to outperform ION, the first algorithm
  solving a similar but more general problem, by two orders of magnitude.
