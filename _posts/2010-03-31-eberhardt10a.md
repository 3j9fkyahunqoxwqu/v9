title: Combining Experiments to Discover Linear Cyclic Models with Latent Variables
abstract: 'We present an algorithm to infer causal relations between a set of measured
  variables on the basis of experiments on these variables. The algorithm assumes
  that the causal relations are linear, but is otherwise completely general: It provides
  consistent estimates when the true causal structure contains feedback loops and
  latent variables, while the experiments can involve surgical or ’soft’ interventions
  on one or multiple variables at a time. The algorithm is ’online’ in the sense that
  it combines the results from any set of available experiments, can incorporate background
  knowledge and resolves conflicts that arise from combining results from different
  experiments. In addition we provide a necessary and sufficient condition that (i)
  determines when the algorithm can uniquely return the true graph, and (ii) can be
  used to select the next best experiment until this condition is satisfied. We demonstrate
  the method by applying it to simulated data and the flow cytometry data of Sachs
  et al (2005).'
