title: On the Convergence Properties of Contrastive Divergence
abstract: Contrastive Divergence (CD) is a popular method for estimating the parameters
  of Markov Random Fields (MRFs) by rapidly approximating an intractable term in the
  gradient of the log probability. Despite CD's empirical success, little is known
  about its theoretical convergence properties.  In this paper, we analyze the CD-1
  update rule for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) with binary variables. We show
  that this update is not the gradient of any function, and construct a counterintuitive
  ``regularization function'' that causes CD learning to cycle indefinitely.  Nonetheless,
  we show that the regularized CD update has a fixed point for a large class of regularization
  functions using Brower's fixed point theorem.
