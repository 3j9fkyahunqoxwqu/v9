title: An Alternative Prior Process for Nonparametric Bayesian Clustering
abstract: 'Prior distributions play a crucial role in Bayesian approaches to clustering.
  Two commonly-used prior distributions are the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes.
  In this paper, we investigate the predictive probabilities that underlie these processes,
  and the implicit “rich-get-richer” characteristic of the resulting partitions. We
  explore an alternative prior for nonparametric Bayesian clustering, the uniform
  process, for applications where the “rich-get-richer” property is undesirable. We
  also explore the cost of this new process: partitions are no longer exchangeable
  with respect to the ordering of variables. We present new asymptotic and simulation-based
  results for the clustering characteristics of the uniform process and compare these
  with known results for the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes. Finally, we compare
  performance on a real document clustering task, demonstrating the practical advantage
  of the uniform process despite its lack of exchangeability over orderings.'
