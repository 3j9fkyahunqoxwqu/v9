title: Neural conditional random fields
abstract: We propose a non-linear graphical model for structured prediction. It combines
  the power of deep neural networks to extract high level features with the graphical
  framework of Markov networks, yielding a powerful and scalable probabilistic model
  that we apply to signal labeling tasks.
