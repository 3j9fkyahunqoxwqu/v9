title: A generalization of the Multiple-try Metropolis algorithm for Bayesian estimation
  and model selection
abstract: We propose a generalization of the Multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) algorithm
  of Liu et al. (2000), which is based on drawing several proposals at each step and
  randomly choosing one of them on the basis of weights that may be arbitrary chosen.
  In particular, for Bayesian estimation we also introduce a method based on weights
  depending on a quadratic approximation of the posterior distribution. The resulting
  algorithm cannot be reformulated as an MTM algorithm and leads to a comparable gain
  of efficiency with a lower computational effort. We also outline the extension of
  the proposed strategy, and then of the MTM strategy, to Bayesian model selection,
  casting it in a Reversible Jump framework. The approach is illustrated by real examples.
