title: Learning Nonlinear Dynamic Models from Non-sequenced Data
abstract: 'Virtually all methods of learning dynamic systems from data start from
  the same basic assumption: the learning algorithm will be given a sequence, or trajectory,
  of data generated from the dynamic system.  We consider the case where the data
  is not sequenced.  The training data points come from the system’s operation but
  with no temporal ordering.  The data are simply drawn as individual disconnected
  points.  While making this assumption may seem absurd at first glance, many scientific
  modeling tasks have exactly this property.  Previous work proposed methods for learning
  linear, discrete time models under these assumptions by optimizing approximate likelihood
  functions.  In this paper, we extend those methods to nonlinear models using kernel
  methods.  We go on to propose a new approach to solving the problem that focuses
  on achieving temporal smoothness in the learned dynamics.  The result is a convex
  criterion that can be easily optimized and often outperforms the earlier methods.  We
  test these methods on several synthetic data sets including one generated from the
  Lorenz attractor.'
