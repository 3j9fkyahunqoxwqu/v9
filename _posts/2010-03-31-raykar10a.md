title: Nonparametric prior for adaptive sparsity
abstract: For high-dimensional problems various parametric priors have been proposed
  to promote sparse solutions. While parametric  priors has shown considerable success
  they are not very robust in adapting to varying degrees of sparsity. In this work
  we propose a discrete mixture prior which is partially nonparametric. The right
  structure for the prior and the amount of sparsity is estimated directly from the
  data. Our experiments show that the proposed prior adapts to sparsity much better
  than its parametric counterparts. We  apply the proposed method to classification
  of high dimensional microarray datasets.
