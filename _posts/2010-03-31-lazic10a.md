title: Solving the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem Using Message Passing Algorithms
abstract: The Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP) is one of the most widely
  studied discrete location problems, whose applications arise in a variety of settings.  We
  tackle the UFLP using probabilistic inference in a graphical model - an approach
  that has received little attention in the past.  We show that the fixed points of
  max-product linear programming (MPLP), a convexified version of the max-product
  algorithm, can be used to construct a solution with a 3-approximation guarantee
  for metric UFLP instances.  In addition, we characterize some scenarios under which
  the MPLP solution is guaranteed to be globally optimal.  We evaluate the performance
  of both max-sum and MPLP empirically on metric and non-metric problems, demonstrating
  the advantages of the 3-approximation construction and algorithm applicability to
  non-metric instances.
