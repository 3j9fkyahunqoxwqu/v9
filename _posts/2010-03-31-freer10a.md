title: Posterior distributions are computable from predictive distributions
abstract: As we devise more complicated prior distributions, will inference algorithms
  keep up?  We highlight a negative result in computable probability theory by Ackerman,
  Freer, and Roy (2010) that shows that there exist computable priors with noncomputable
  posteriors.  In addition to providing a brief survey of computable probability theory
  geared towards the A.I. and statistics community, we give a new result characterizing
  when conditioning is computable in the setting of exchangeable sequences, and provide
  a computational perspective on work by Orbanz (2010) on conjugate nonparametric
  models.  In particular, using a computable extension of de Finettiâ€™s theorem (Freer
  and Roy 2009), we describe how to transform a posterior predictive rule for generating
  an exchangeable sequence into an algorithm for computing the posterior distribution
  of the directing random measure.
