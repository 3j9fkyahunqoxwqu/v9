title: Combining Experiments to Discover Linear Cyclic Models with Latent Variables
abstract: 'We present an algorithm to infer causal relations between a set of measured
  variables on the basis of experiments on these variables. The algorithm assumes
  that the causal relations are linear, but is otherwise completely general: It provides
  consistent estimates when the true causal structure contains feedback loops and
  latent variables, while the experiments can involve surgical or ''soft'' interventions
  on one or multiple variables at a time. The algorithm is ''online'' in the sense
  that it combines the results from any set of available experiments, can incorporate
  background knowledge and resolves conflicts that arise from combining results from
  different experiments. In addition we provide a necessary and sufficient condition
  that (i) determines when the algorithm can uniquely return the true graph, and (ii)
  can be used to select the next best experiment until this condition is satisfied.
  We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated data and the flow cytometry
  data of Sachs et al (2005).'
