title: A Weighted Multi-Sequence Markov Model For Brain Lesion Segmentation
abstract: We propose a technique for fusing the output of multiple Magnetic Resonance
  (MR) sequences to robustly and accurately segment brain lesions. It is based on
  an augmented multi-sequence Hidden Markov model that includes additional weight
  variables to account for the relative importance and control the impact of each
  sequence. The augmented framework has the advantage of allowing 1) the incorporation
  of expert knowledge on the  a priori relevant information content of each sequence
  and 2) a weighting scheme which is modified adaptively according to the data and
  the segmentation task under consideration. The model, applied to the detection of
  multiple sclerosis and stroke lesions shows promising results.
